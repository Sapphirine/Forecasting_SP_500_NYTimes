## Forecasting S&amp;P 500 Index Using NY Times Data

### Dataset: 
The dataset is from New York Times Article Search API through nytimesarticle package in Python. We have 798 csv files in total and the size is 2.92GB. 

### Tools: 
R, Python, Spark 

### Analytics: 
1. Unigram TF-IDF is used to generate features. 
2. Try some machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. 
3. Employ sparsity algorithms thus as LASSO and Elastic Net Regularization for the exploratory model.
